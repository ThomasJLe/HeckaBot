1.	Download and install Ubuntu from https://ubuntu.com/download/desktop and at least one other Linux Distro (Distribution)
a.	Screen shots of logins 
2.	Complete the template below for each downloaded distro.

a.	screen shot
4.	Install an Apache HTTP Server on one of the downloaded distros.  (we will configure it in another lesson)
5.	What package manager do the distros use (e.g., apt, yum)?   Research how to install git via the command line. 
If possible, provide screenshots of the command being issued, the installation process, the completion of the installation, and running git on the command line
a.	Answers and Screen shots
There are hundreds of Linux distributions. Below is a list of commonly used distributions.
1.	Debian
2.	Ubuntu
3.	Linux Mint
4.	Manjaro
5.	Antergos
6.	Chakra
7.	Fedora
8.	CentOS
9.	Oracle Linux
10.	Open Suse
These 10 distributions are derived from 4 major distributions.
1.	Debian (Derivatives: Ubuntu, Linux Mint)
2.	Arch Linux (Derivatives: Manjaro, Antergos, Chakra)
3.	Red Hat Linux (Derivatives: Fedora, CentOS, Oracle Linux
4.	Open Suse
Most distributions ship with a desktop environment. The most commonly used ones are Gnome and KDE. However, there are other GUIs such as XFCE, Cinnamon, Mate, 
Unity, and so forth.
Distributions often prefer a package manager. Debian-based distributions often use apt, Arch Linux-based distributions often use pacman,
 and Red Hat-based distributions often use yum or dnf. Open Suse-based distributions use several package managers including apt and yum.
