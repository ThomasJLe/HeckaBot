The people who work at apple are nothing but scummy people ~ David Heckathorn.

The year is 1983, first time consumer David Heckathorn has just bought his Apple Lisa.
Proud of his inital buy, he gets to work on his device. Utilizing the world's finest current piece
of technology, David continues his career in the computer science field. A successful of development
passes and within that new year comes a brand new Apple product, the Macintosh. 

So why does David Heckathorn hate Apple with a passion? Rather than upgrading their product to the
best of their ability at once, these scummy people instead opt to out put yearly products to drive
up a consumer demand for the latest in product.
