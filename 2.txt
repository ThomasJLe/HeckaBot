CPSC 254 Lab #2 
Postscript Font Installation

1.	Read FreeBSD Handbook Chapter 5
2.	On your FreeBSD installation, install XORG
3.	Install Postscript fonts
4.	Add a path for fonts to the X11 configuration file (might be a new file)
5.	Install and enable either KDE or Gnome (your choice.  I prefer Gnome, but either choice will do)
6.	Email a screen shot of use of one of the new fonts.  Due before class next week.

Exit and reboot.  Did everything work?  If not, why?
